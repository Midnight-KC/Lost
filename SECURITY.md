For the security of the users I am working on getting a security system up and going but it would be rudementry until I get some other things taken care of so that the site will function properly. Thank you for understanding.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability within the site please leave a comment or if you can help and are willing to help with the progress of the site please let me know and I'll consider give you access to the program and the repository so that you can help. If I can find the vulnerability that you have then I will do my best to get it fixed ASAP but it may take a while for me to figure it out since I am the only one working on it at the moment
